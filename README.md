# Superhero

Welcome to the Super Selector Gem.  Here you will be able to select super(heroes or villains) by name, through lists based on studios, or one randomized list optimized for exploring Supers unknown.  Hope you enjoy!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'superhero'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install superhero

## Usage

Please run the super_search file to begin the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
